    HRV: "HRV (Heart Rate Variability) — a measure of the variation in time between each heartbeat. It is an indicator of your autonomic nervous system activity.",
    "Sleep Score": "Sleep Score — a score that indicates the quality and duration of your sleep. It helps you understand your sleep patterns.",
    "No Activity Score": "No Activity Score — a score that indicates periods of inactivity. It helps you track sedentary behavior.",
    "Sleep Latency": "Sleep Latency — the amount of time it takes you to fall asleep. It is an indicator of your sleep onset.",
    "Stress Level": "Stress Level — a score that indicates your stress levels. It helps you manage and reduce stress for better well-being.",
    "Activity Level": "Activity Level — a score that measures your physical activity levels throughout the day. It helps you track your fitness progress.",
    "Sleep Quality": "Sleep Quality — a score that indicates the quality of your sleep. It helps you understand your sleep patterns.",
    "Awake Time": "Awake time is the time spent awake in bed before and after falling asleep.",
    "Bedtime": "Bedtime is an estimate of the time you went to bed with the intention to sleep.",
    "Deep Sleep Time": "Deep sleep is the most restorative and rejuvenating sleep stage, enabling muscle growth and repair. The amount of deep sleep can vary significantly between nights and individuals. It can make up anywhere between 0-35% of your total sleep time. On average adults spend 15-20% (1-1.5 h) of their total sleep time in deep sleep, the percentage usually decreasing with age.",
    "Light Sleep Time": "Light sleep makes up about 50% of total sleep time for adults, and typically begins a sleep cycle.",
    "REM Sleep Time": "REM (rapid eye movement) sleep is the final sleep stage in a typical sleep cycle. It’s associated with dreaming, memory consolidation, learning and creativity.",
    "Respiratory Rate": "Oura tracks the number of breaths you take per minute while you sleep, and shows your nocturnal average respiratory rate. Although your respiratory rate is not used to score your readiness, it is a good indicator of your health status. The typical respiratory rate for a healthy adult at rest is 12–20 breaths per minute. Because breathing is highly individual, it's best to compare your numbers to your own baseline.",
    "Restfulness": "Sleep disturbances caused by wake-ups and restless time can have a big impact on your sleep quality and daytime cognitive performance. Restless sleep is less restorative than uninterrupted sleep, and it's usually the cause of daytime sleepiness. Disturbances can be caused by various different factors, such as stress, noise, partners, pets or different foods.",
    "Resting Heart Rate": "Measuring your resting heart rate during the day can give insight into how your body’s doing. A moment of relaxing, meditating or just being still can take your heart rate down, helping your body to recover and re-energize.",
    "Sleep Efficiency": "Sleep efficiency is the percentage of time you actually spend asleep after going to bed. For adults, a generally accepted cut-off score for good sleep efficiency is 85%. It's common for sleep efficiency to slightly decrease with age. For a maximum positive contribution to your sleep score, your sleep efficiency needs to be 95%. You'll see a lowered sleep score if it has taken more than 20 minutes for you to fall asleep, or if you experience one long or multiple shorter wake-ups during the night.",
    "Sleep Midpoint Time": "The time in seconds from the start of sleep to the midpoint of sleep. The midpoint ignores awake periods.",
    "Sleep Timing": "Your sleep timing plays an important role in your sleep quality and daytime performance. Most of your body’s essential processes such as your body temperature, hormone release and hunger run in 24-hour cycles called circadian rhythms. Sleeping during the night and staying awake and active during the day can help keep these internal rhythms in balance, and helps you perform better throughout the day. Oura considers your sleep timing to be optimal and aligned with the sun when the midpoint of your sleep falls between midnight and 3 am, allowing some variability for morning and evening types. A timing significantly earlier or later can lower your Sleep Score.",
    "Total Sleep Time": "Total sleep time refers to the total amount of time you spend in light, REM and deep sleep.",
    "Wake-up Time": "Wake-up time is the time you got out of bed.",
    "Readiness Score": "Readiness Score: Ranging from 0-1000, the readiness score helps you identify the days that are ideal for challenging yourself, and those that are better for taking it easy.",
    "Activity Balance": "Activity Balance measures how your activity level over the past days is affecting your readiness to perform. A full bar indicates that you've been active, but kept from training at your maximum capacity. This has boosted your recovery and helped build up your energy levels.",
    "Average HRV": "When a person is relaxed, a healthy heart’s beating rate shows remarkable variation in the time interval between heartbeats. By calculating this variation i.e. your heart rate variability (HRV) while you sleep, Oura can help you better understand your body’s reactions and your readiness to perform.",
  "Body Temperature": "Body temperature variations can reveal a lot about your recovery and overall health. It’s normal for body temperature to rise after eating, drinking or exercising late, or when sleeping in a warm environment. A sudden rise can also indicate that you’re coming down with something. When this happens, it’s a good idea to take your temperature with a thermometer, and allow yourself to rest.",
  "Previous Day Activity": "Your level of physical activity yesterday is one of the key contributors to your Readiness Score. When the contributor is at 100%, you’ll know you’ve balanced your need for activity and rest, and substituted a nice amount of inactive time with low activity. An exceptionally high amount of inactivity or activity leads to a drop in your Readiness Score. If your readiness is low due to intense training and increased Activity Burn, taking time to recover can pay off as improved fitness.",
  "Recovery Index": "Recovery Index measures how long it takes for your resting heart rate to stabilize during the night. A sign of very good recovery is that your resting heart rate stabilizes during the first half of the night, at least 6 hours before you wake up, leaving your body time to recover for the next day. Alcohol, a heavy meal before bed or late exercise speed up your metabolism and keep your heart rate elevated, delaying your recovery and increasing your sleep needs.",
  "Sleep Balance": "Sleep Balance shows if the sleep you've been getting over the past two weeks is in balance with your needs. Typically adults need 7-9 hours of sleep a night to stay healthy, alert, and to perform at their best both mentally and physically.",
  "Resting Time": "Resting time includes naps and other restful periods that last for at least 5 minutes.",
  "Stay Active": "Moving around regularly and avoiding long periods of inactivity helps you stay healthy, and keeps your metabolism active throughout the day. Having 5-8 hours or less of inactive time a day has a positive effect on your Activity Score.",
  "Steps": "Daily step count is one measure of your daily physical activity. The optimal number of daily steps depends on your age, body size, fitness level and readiness to perform.",
  "Total Burn": "Total Burn, or your total daily energy expenditure includes all the calories you've burned during the day whether active or resting. Tracking your total burn and comparing it to your data history can help you adjust your calorie intake and maintain a healthy weight. While physical activity increases your daily calorie burn, most of your total burn comes from the calories your body burns while at rest, also known as your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). Oura begins calculating your total burn at 4 am by logging your estimated BMR. Continuing to calculate until 4 am the next morning, all calories burned by your daily activity are added to the sum.",
  "Training Frequency": "Training Frequency shows how often you've gotten medium to high intensity level activity over the past 7 days. Exercising 3-4 times a week will help you to stay in balance and boost your Activity Score.",
  "Training Volume": "Training Volume measures the amount of medium and high activity you’ve gotten over the past 7 days. Like training frequency, your training volume is important for maintaining and improving your fitness level.",
  "Walking Equivalency": "Walking equivalency shows your daily activity burn as a walking distance.",
  "Activity Score": "Ranging from 0-100, the activity score is an overall measure of how active you've been today, and over the past 7 days.",
  "Activity Burn": "Activity burn shows the kilocalories you've burned by daily movement and exercise.",
  "Activity daily movement": "Oura gives you a minimum daily Activity Target based on your age, sex and daily readiness. When your Readiness Score is above 85%, your Activity Target will be set higher than your average. Days like these are usually optimal for taking your training to the next level and developing your physical performance. When your readiness drops below 70%, your Activity Target is lowered, and avoiding or reducing intensive training might be in order.",
  "Average MET": "This is the daily average MET for when you are awake. MET or Metabolic Equivalent is a common measure used to express the energy expenditure and intensity of different physical activities. If the MET value of a specific activity is 4, it means that you’re burning 4 times as many calories as you would burn while resting. The time engaged in different activities can be expressed as MET minutes. For example: 30 min x 5 METs = 150 MET min, 30 min x 7 METs = 210 MET min.",
  "High Activity": "High activity includes vigorous activities with an intensity level higher or equivalent to jogging.",
  "Inactive Time": "Inactive time includes sitting, standing or otherwise being passive.",
  "Long periods of inactivity": "This contributor shows how well you’ve managed to avoid long periods of inactivity during the past 24 hours. Oura tracks the time you spend sitting, standing or otherwise passive, and guides you to break up long periods of inactivity.",
  "Low Activity": "Low activity includes activities such as casual walking and light housework both indoors and outdoors. During low activity your energy expenditure (calorie burn) is about 2–4 times higher compared to your resting level.",
  "Medium Activity": "Medium activity includes dynamic activities with an intensity level equivalent to brisk walking.",
  "Meet Daily Targets": "Meet Daily Targets shows how often you’ve reached your daily activity targets over the past 7 days. Oura gives you a daily activity target based on your age, sex and readiness level.",
  "Move Every Hour": "Move Every Hour shows how well you’ve managed to avoid long periods of sitting, standing or otherwise being passive during the past 24 hours. Staying active and moving for 2-3 minutes regularly helps you to avoid the harmful effects of inactivity.",
  "Recovery Time": "To improve your fitness, you need regular exercise but also easier days that help your body recover — it’s during rest that your muscles repair and grow. Recovery time tracks the number of easy days you’ve had during a week, and the timing of the last easy day."
